<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
By using this connector you will have the ability to import data into HelloID:

* Student Demographics
* Student Enrollment Periods

## Setting up the API Access
The purpose of this is to provide steps on generating and using key based authentication for Student Rest APIs

* Introduction 
The Application API Keys configuration is enhanced to be used when authenticating to the entire Student REST API set instead of only being used for the Campuslink APIs. 

This enhancement:
    * Limits the integrating partners to only access the modules to which they have permissions. Appropriate audits will be recorded in the database. 
    * Allows the integrating partner to generate their own application key, associated to a user in the Staff entity. 

* Steps
    * Location - Select Settings > System > Application API Keys.
